# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The goal is to understand the factors that affected passenger survival.

# Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

# Project Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize survival patterns based on:
- Gender
- Passenger class
- Age distribution
- Identify and visualize missing data

# Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

# Key Insights

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) were more likely to survive.
- Most passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.
- There are missing values in the `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` columns.
